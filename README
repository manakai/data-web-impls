Lists of top Japanese Web site of month YYYY-MM, extracted from the
daily Hatena Bookmark ranking <http://b.hatena.ne.jp/ranking/daily>.

These files contain list of pairs of the site and one of URLs in the
site from the ranking, as the lines of the values separated by a
U+0020 character.  (When there are multiple URLs in a same site in the
ranking, only one of them are chosen for the list.)  The site is
identified by the ASCII serialization of the eTLD+1 of the host of the
URL.  The order of the lines in the files is not significant.

In 2017-03 the ranking page of the service has been removed.
